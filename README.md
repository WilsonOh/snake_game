# My attempt on recreating the snake game using pygame

## Features

- Infinite game -> you can never die
- Snake appears out of the opposite wall when you slither into a wall
- Snake will cannibalize itself when it hits its own body, shortening its length
- Keep eating the fruit to become infinitely long!

## Customization

- Edit the various settings in the `settings.py` file to your liking
- DRAW_GRID is on by default - set it to `False` to remove grid lines

## How to play

- Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move the snake around
- Press the Escape Key to pause and unpause the game

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10 and higher
- pygame
